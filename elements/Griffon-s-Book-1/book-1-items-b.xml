	<element name="Bag of Sundrops" type="Magic Item" source="The Griffon's Saddlebag Book 1" id="ID_TGSB_B1_MAGIC_ITEM_BAG_OF_SUNDROPS" >
		<description>
			<p>This small, colorful bag is filled with 1d6 + 4 golden, marble-like orbs called sundrops that glow softly when held. As an action, you can throw a sundrop at a point or object you can see within 30 feet. When you do, the orb explodes into a dazzling pillar of light that lasts until the start of your next turn. The pillar is a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder of bright light centered on the point where the sundrop shattered. The light is sunlight.</p>
			<p class="indent">A <i>dispel magic</i> spell targeting the light ends the effect early.</p>

	<element name="Band of Mirrored Essence" type="Magic Item" source="The Griffon's Saddlebag Book 1" id="ID_TGSB_B1_MAGIC_ITEM_BAND_OF_MIRRORE_ESSENCE" >
		<description>
			<p>This unassuming platinum ring is polished to a mirror finish. When you reduce a Small or larger hostile creature to 0 hit points while wearing the ring, you can use your reaction to absorb a portion of that creature’s essence into the ring. Looking into the ring shows the reflection of the creature whose essence is held inside. As an action, you can release the captured essence and assume either the creature’s appearance or one of its features.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you take on the appearance of the creature, it must be a creature no more than one size larger or smaller than you. You do not physically change in size or shape, but your body is shrouded in a convincing illusion. Your voice changes to match the creature’s, and you can understand any of its known languages but can neither read nor speak any that you don’t already know. Another creature can see through the illusion by succeeding on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Physical interaction with this illusory form reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. The illusion lasts for 8 hours or until you dismiss it as a bonus action or fall unconscious.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you assume one of the creature’s features, your body or mind temporarily changes to accommodate the new ability. You can choose to gain 1 skill or saving throw proficiency, damage resistance, condition immunity, sense, or language that the creature had. If the creature could breathe underwater, you can choose to gain that feature instead. You retain this feature for 8 hours or until you dismiss it as a bonus action or fall unconscious.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you capture an essence with the ring, you can’t do so again for 1d8 hours. You can only have 1 essence at a time. If you capture an essence when you already have one, you replace the original.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The compass-like mechanisms on top of these matching leather bracelets remain motionless until each bracelet is worn by a different creature. While they’re worn, each compass points in the direction of the other matching band. It doesn’t indicate height or depth. The compasses spin wildly if the two bands are worn on different planes of existence.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This small music box can play songs at the request of the holder. As a bonus action, you can command the box to play a song for which it has music, causing the contraption to emit a slightly tinny rendition of the musical number. The box can know up to 5 songs at a time but can’t recreate lyrics or other creature sounds. The box has a knob on its side to adjust its volume: able to be as quiet as a whisper or as loud as a scream.</p>
			<p class="indent">Sheet music can be fed into the box through a narrow slot along the bottom of the device. Sheet music must be labeled with a song title, page number, and instrument in order to be replayed. Pages failing to meet the requirements cause the box to make a sad, discordant noise before being spat back out. Once a sheet is successfully fed into the box, it is consumed and can’t be retrieved.</p>
			<p class="indent">If a new piece of music causes the box to forget an older one, it quickly plays several bars of the now-forgotten number before it slows to a stop.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This flat, rugged helmet lets you run headlong into targets and bowl them over with abandon. If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then shove them on the same turn, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage from being barreled into by the helmet.</p>

	<element name="Barricade Shield" type="Magic Item" source="The Griffon's Saddlebag Book 1" id="ID_TGSB_B1_MAGIC_ITEM_BARRICADE_SHIELD" >
		<description>
			<p>While holding this sturdy iron shield, you can use an action to plant it on the ground and expand its height and width to stretch up to 15 feet across in either direction, potentially becoming a defensive wall or similar platform. The edges of the shield magically conform to fit the shape of an enclosed space, such as the walls of a tunnel or hallway. While holding the expanded shield in place, your speed becomes 0 and you have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws. Regardless of the shield’s size, its weight always remains the same.</p>
			<p class="indent">The expanded shield is considered a nonmagical structure that has AC 14 and 40 hit points. The shield can remain expanded for up to 1 minute before it reverts back to its normal size. The expanded shield reverts early (but is not destroyed) if it reaches 0 hit points or moves. If you’re holding the expanded shield, you can choose to revert it early using a bonus action.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

	<element name="Basco’s Handy Bangle" type="Magic Item" source="The Griffon's Saddlebag Book 1" id="ID_TGSB_B1_MAGIC_ITEM_BASCOS_HANDY_BANGLE" >
		<description>
			<p>This shiny platinum bangle is inlaid with arcane runes that seem to be written by different hands. Labels can be read behind each of the adorning runes on the inside of the bangle. As an action, you can touch one of the runes and say the command phrase, “I can do this,” to gain proficiency in the rune’s associated tool for the next 24 hours. The rune glows with arcane energy while in effect. Once a rune is activated in this way, it can’t be activated again until 1d4 days have passed.</p>
			<p class="indent">There are 10 runes on the bangle that can be activated in this way: alchemist’s supplies, carpenter’s tools, cook’s utensils, leatherworker’s tools, smith’s tools, tinker’s tools, instruments (drum, flute, lute, lyre), navigator’s tools, thieves’ tools, and vehicles (water). If you’re already proficient with any of these tools, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the tool while the rune is active.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This magic dagger was made from pieces of a slain basilisk and still retains some of its properties. The dagger deals an extra 1d4 poison damage to any target it hits.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, when you score a critical hit with this weapon against a Large or smaller creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be restrained until the end of your next turn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This bubbly potion is frothy and smells like lavender. When you drink this potion, any dirt and grime on your body is magically rinsed away. Further, your breath, hair, and nails are suddenly cleaned, looking either polished and pristine or smelling of daisies and honey for the next 24 hours. Bubbles occasionally escape from your mouth while the potion is in effect.</p>

		<description>
			<p>While holding this segmented, 1-foot-long rod, you can speak its command word as an action to cause it to extend in either direction. The rod can extend up to 50 feet or as far as the surrounding space allows. If the rod touches another creature or surface before reaching its full length, the rod stops moving in that direction. If it stops moving against a solid, unmoving surface, the rod fills the gaps to hold firm against it.</p>
			<p class="indent">The rod is unwieldy to hold once it’s longer than 10 feet, forcing you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to maintain your grip on it while it’s extended beyond that range. The DC for this check is equal to 8 + 1 for every 5 feet beyond 10 that the rod is extended. For example, the DC is 9 while the rod is 15 feet long, but 16 while a full 50 feet. If you lose your grip and drop the rod or use it to make an attack while it’s extended more than 10 feet, it immediately retracts back to its shortened length. You can speak the rod’s command word again as an action to cause it to retract.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This golden battleaxe is the chosen weapon of many merchants and followers of mercantile deities. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against a Small or larger hostile creature, you magically earn a number of gold coins equal to the attack’s damage. When you do, the axe glimmers like a sparkling coin, and you can sense the weight and clink of coins magically falling into your purse, pocket, or bag (your choice). If you have no room for the coins or don’t want them to be immediately added to your storage, the coins erupt from the wound you inflict on the target instead. Once the axe generates coins in this way, it can’t create any more for 12 hours.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The head of this maul is an alchemical keg that generates battlebrew liquor, a favorite among dwarves and half-orcs. The keg holds up to 4 gallons of the liquor and creates 1 gallon each day at dawn and again each time you roll for initiative while holding it. A creature can use its action to remove or reattach the handle of the maul to the keg, and another action to pour out or stopper it.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While held in combat, the hammer heats the liquor inside it. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6 acid damage as the hammer buckles from the impact and releases a spray of the volatile liquor.</p>
			<p class="indent">For 1 minute after a target has been sprayed with acid in this way, the next time that target takes fire damage, it takes an extra 2d6 fire damage as the liquor ignites.</p>

			<p>This small shield is the repurposed pot lid of a famous adventuring chef. While wielding the shield, you have advantage on saving throws to resist or avoid taking fire damage. In addition, if you place the shield face down over a pot or similar vessel that’s holding no more than 2 gallons of a water-based liquid inside, the vessel and its liquid comes to a rolling boil after 10 minutes.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This magic saucepan can be used to turn nearly anything into a delicious and filling meal. You can boil 1 pound of any one or combination of organic, nonmagical materials for 10 minutes or longer to magically transform them into a stew that can nourish up to 4 creatures for 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="indent">The saucepan also functions as a mace, granting you a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The saucepan deals an extra 1d4 thunder damage to any target it hits that’s either wearing metal armor or made of metal or stone.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you’re not wearing heavy armor, you can use an action to either wear or remove the saucepan as a helmet. While wearing the saucepan in this way, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC.</p>

			<p>This magic bow is enchanted with passive abjuration protections. When you hit a creature with a ranged attack using this bow, the bow creates a thin barrier of protective magic that stays between you and that creature until the start of your next turn. If you hit a different creature while protected by this barrier, the barrier moves to defend you against the new target instead. While the barrier is protecting you against a creature in this way, you’re considered to have half cover against that creature’s ranged attacks and spell effects.</p>

			<p>This thick leather belt is reinforced with large rivets and secured with a heavy iron skull buckle. While wearing this belt, you can use an action to let loose a powerful war cry that inspires you and up to 5 friendly creatures within 60 feet of you of your choice that can hear you. An inspired creature has advantage on attack rolls until the start of your next turn. When you use this property of the belt, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.</p>

			<p class="indent">If you take any damage while flying in this way, you lose concentration on the toy and immediately start falling.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the toy is of uncommon rarity, the toy cannot be used again for 1d4 hours. It gives a happy little chirp when its magic can be used again.</p>

	<element name="Blizzard Sphere" type="Magic Item" source="The Griffon's Saddlebag Book 1" id="ID_TGSB_B1_MAGIC_ITEM_BLIZZARD_SPHERE" >
		<description>
			<p>This glass sphere contains a raging blizzard inside. It’s cold to the touch and vibrates with the gusts of wind trapped within. As an action, you can throw the orb at a point or object you can see within 30 feet, shattering it on impact. When the orb shatters, the blizzard erupts from the glass in a 20-foot-radius sphere of swirling ice and snow centered on the point of impact. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 cold damage and its speed is halved until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much cold damage and its speed is unaffected.</p>
			<p class="indent">The blizzard remains for 1d4 rounds or until targeted by a <i>dispel magic</i> spell (DC 15 or cast at 5th level or higher). Any surface within the area is covered in a slick sheet of ice and sleet, turning the ground within the sphere into difficult terrain that remains for the effect’s duration. While the blizzard persists, the area is heavily obscured.</p>

		<description>
			<p>These iron pendants come in pairs and are connected by a powerful bond of self-sacrifice. In order to create this bond, you and a friendly creature with whom you are close perform a brief, 1-minute ritual to connect your destinies and forge a blood pact. When you create this blood pact, you must each agree on a number of hit points to permanently sacrifice and reduce your total maximum hit points by (minimum 1). Once a pact has been forged, trickles of the bound creatures’ blood are absorbed into the normally clear gems adorning the faces of these pendants. While the gem is filled in this way, it seems to gently swirl and pulse in time with your heartbeat.</p>
			<p class="indent">While the bound creatures are wearing their respective pendants and are on the same plane of existence, they’re protected by this pact so long as one creature is still conscious. When a bound creature dies, it’s immediately revived with 2d10 hit points plus twice the number of hit points it had sacrificed. When a creature is revived in this way, the other bound creature immediately falls to 0 hit points and is knocked unconscious, ending the blood pact and restoring both creatures’ hit point maximums to normal. This property ignores any effect that would normally prevent a creature from falling to 0 hit points. Once the pact is ended in this way, the gems and pendants crack and are no longer magical.</p>

	<element name="Bloodmage Dagger" type="Magic Item" source="The Griffon's Saddlebag Book 1" id="ID_TGSB_B1_MAGIC_ITEM_BLOODMAGE_DAGGER" >
		<description>
			<p>This roughly hewn obsidian dagger is razor sharp and can be used as a spellcasting focus. Its handle is covered in small holes that drink in whatever blood runs down the blade. There’s a small reservoir for blood at the dagger’s pommel that seems to never completely fill. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">The dagger has 5 charges and regains 1d3 + 2 expended charges daily at dusk. While holding the dagger, you can expend 1 of its charges as an action to make a melee spell attack using your spell attack bonus against a living creature you can see within 5 feet of you. When you do, an illusory crimson dagger sweeps out towards the creature. A creature hit by this attack takes necrotic damage equal to 3d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and you regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. If the target is a construct, plant, or undead creature, you don’t regain any hit points in this way.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alternatively, while holding the dagger, you can expend 1 or more of its charges when you cast a spell using a 1st, 2nd, or 3rd-level spell slot. The spell must target either a single creature or yourself. The spell slot you use to cast this spell counts as one level higher for each charge you expend in this way. You can’t increase a spell slot level beyond 5th level in this way. When you use this property of the dagger, you also expend 1 Hit Die for each charge you expend in this way. Roll a number of Hit Dice equal to the number of expended charges and take necrotic damage equal to the total you roll. This damage ignores resistance and immunity. If expending charges in this way causes you to fall to 0 hit points, the spell fails and you fall unconscious.</p>

		<description>
			<p>These red goggles have a second set of lenses that magically adjust their distance from your eyes to magnify and focus on targets. While you’re attuned to these goggles, you are unaffected by visual obscurity such as fog or smoke and can see up to 60 feet in magical and nonmagical darkness. If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet. Additionally, you gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.</p>
			<p class="indent">These lenses are also imbued with several innate spells. While wearing the goggles, you can cast the following spells from them, using your spell save DC, but can only target creatures whose blood you can see: <i>hunter’s mark</i> (3rd-level version), <i>locate creature</i>, or <i>scrying</i>. Casting a spell in this way does not require you to concentrate on the spell in order to maintain it. Once the oculus casts a spell in this way, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This heavy crossbow is made of metal and fires small bolts of electricity instead of normal ammunition. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you pull the string back to load the crossbow, the string crackles with energy and loads a small bolt of lightning ammunition instead. Attacks made with this crossbow deal 1d12 lightning damage instead of 1d10 piercing. In addition, whenever you make a ranged attack with this weapon against a metal target or a creature wearing metal armor, you make the attack with advantage.</p>
			<p class="indent">This crossbow acts as a small lightning rod. If another creature within 10 feet of you takes lightning damage while you’re holding the crossbow, you take 1d6 lightning damage for every 10 lightning damage the other creature took.</p>

	<element name="Boots of Dendallen" type="Magic Item" source="The Griffon's Saddlebag Book 1" id="ID_TGSB_B1_MAGIC_ITEM_BOOTS_OF_DENDALLEN" >
		<description>
			<p>These dark, fleshy boots grant marvelous powers and enhance your normal movement. While wearing these boots, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. You can hover up to 20 feet off the ground in this way, leaving behind a thin trail of shadow when you do. In addition, when you take the Dash action while wearing the boots, you can move an extra 10 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">The boots have 4 charges and regain 1d3 + 1 expended charges daily at dusk. While wearing the boots, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of their charges to cast either the expeditious retreat or misty step spell from them. When you cast misty step in this way, the normally silver mist that surrounds you is dark and ominous.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Curse.</i></b> When you pull these boots over your feet for the first time, make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a success, you are aware of the curse’s effects and can immediately remove the boots before they extend it to you. On a failure, the boots’ muscly sinews dig into your legs and feet, interlocking with your own flesh. You immediately take 4d8 necrotic damage as the tainted muscles and flesh latch onto you, and you can’t remove the boots unless you’re targeted by the <i>remove curse</i> spell or similar magic. While you wear the boots, your feet sometimes move in unexpected ways. You make Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks and Dexterity saving throws with disadvantage, and it costs you an extra 10 feet of movement to stand up after you fall prone.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you fail the saving throw to resist the curse and later remove the boots, you take another 4d8 necrotic damage as they painfully tear themselves from your body.</p>

		<description>
			<p>While wearing these boots, you can jump while in the air as if you’d leapt from solid ground. You can’t jump farther than your remaining movement would allow, and you treat all jumps made in this way as they were standing jumps. When you make a mid-air jump, faint clouds fly out from under your feet. The boots allow you to jump in this way once before they need to make contact with a solid surface again. Jumping in this way while falling before landing on solid ground prevents up to 20 feet of fall damage.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This crystalline, prismatic wand can channel the illustrative intent of its wielder. While holding the wand, you can magically create a stroke of color in the air, allowing you to draw in midair or on any surface the wand touches. The effect is illusory, visibly magical, radiates dim light out to 5 feet, and dissipates after 1 hour.</p>
			<p class="indent">If you attempt to draw on an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw in order to avoid it.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This enlarged, floating snowflake is magically held in place and changes its shape as temperatures fluctuate. While attuned to the pendant you have resistance to cold damage and give off an aura of cheeriness. The snowflake has 8 charges and regains 1d6+2 expended charges each day at dawn. While wearing it, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the following spells using a spell save DC of 15: <i>charm person</i> (1 charge), <i>color spray</i> (1 charge), <i>hypnotic pattern</i> (3 charges), or <i>ice storm</i> (4 charges).</p>
			<p class="indent">If you expend the pendant’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the snowflake melts into a puddle of water. After 1 year, the pendant reforms around the magical golden brackets that hold it in place.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This small vial has a single dose of a fuming, pitch-black poison inside of it. When a creature eats or drinks the poison, it takes 4d6 psychic damage and must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes blind and unable to sleep. When an affected creature attempts to rest, their dreams are plagued with terrible nightmares, preventing them from benefiting from a long rest. The creature can reattempt the saving throw once every 24 hours.</p>
			<p class="indent">The poison lasts until the affected creature succeeds on a saving throw or is cured by the <i>greater restoration</i>, <i>heal</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This spear has a hollow metal head filled with a spring-loaded net. Attacks made with this weapon deal bludgeoning damage instead of piercing. When you hit a target with a melee attack using the weapon, you can press a button on the handle as a bonus action to deploy the spring-loaded net. When you do, the target of the attack is restrained if it’s Large or smaller. Once the net is deployed, you can retract and reset it as an action. When you do, anything held by the net is released. Attacks with the spear are made with disadvantage while the net is deployed. If something is restrained by the net, you can’t use the spear to make weapon attacks.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use a bonus action to prime the net to trigger upon impact, allowing it to deploy when the spear hits a target the next time it’sthrown or swung as part of an attack.</p>
			<p class="indent">This net follows the net’s normal rules but cannot be detached from the spear without destroying the net. You can replace the net with a new one by spending 1 minute attaching it to the spear.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Arrows fired from this magic bow deal an extra 1d4 psychic damage to any creature that they hit</p>
			<p class="indent">When you hit a humanoid with an arrow in this way, you can force that creature to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw after the attack. On a failed save, that creature falls under the effects of the dominate person spell for up to 1 minute as if cast by you. This effect does not require concentration. In addition, you can use a bonus action to see through that creature’s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the creature has. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. Once this property of the bow has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.</p>

	<element name="Braided Quarterstaf" type="Magic Item" source="The Griffon's Saddlebag Book 1" id="ID_TGSB_B1_MAGIC_ITEM_BRAIDED_QUARTERSTAFF" >
		<description>
			<p>This magical quarterstaff is made of a tightly knit length of braided rope. As a bonus action, you can speak the weapon’s command word to release its knotted form and loosen it into a 50-foot length of hempen rope. Speaking the command word again causes the rope to tighten back up into the quarterstaff. If a creature is restrained by the rope when you speak its command word, the rope tightens around the creature but does not crush it. Once tightened in this way, the restrained creature or an adjacent ally can use an action to escape following a successful DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (their choice).</p>
			<p class="indent">Tying an object no larger than six inches on a side to the end of the rope does not prevent it from reforming into the quarterstaff. The rope can only be broken by magical means. If broken, the rope cannot be transformed back into a quarterstaff.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This wooden quiver can carry your arrows as well as provide some of its own. The quiver has 4 grown arrows and regrows 1d3 + 1 picked arrows daily at dawn. The grown arrows are thorned and remain attached to the quiver until picked for use (no action required). While you’re attuned to the quiver, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with these magic arrows. A grown arrow is no longer magical after 1 minute has passed since it was first picked from the quiver.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you fire and hit a target or point with one of these magic arrows, you can use a bonus action on that same turn to speak the quiver’s command word. When you do, that arrow transforms into a thick field of thorns to recreate the effects of the <i>spike growth</i> spell, centered on its location. This effect does not require concentration and lasts until the start of your next turn. If the arrow was lodged in a target when you use this property, that target also takes 2d4 piercing damage.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You have a +1 bonus to your AC. You can use an action on your turn to channel the armor’s magic to cause it emit a flash of blinding, radiant light. When you do, all other creatures within 30 feet of you are forced to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature is blinded until the end of its next turn. Undead creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 2d8 radiant damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. Once this property of the armor has been used, it can’t be used again until the following dawn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This metal brooch features a rotatable dial and can be used to secure a cape or adorn a piece of clothing. While wearing the brooch, you can use an action to cast the <i>enlarge/reduce</i> spell, targeting only yourself, by turning the dial toward either the larger or smaller figure adorning the sides of the brooch. Once this property of the brooch has been used, it can’t be used again until the following dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent">While under the effects of this spell, you can use a bonus action to overload the brooch by forcibly twisting the dial beyond its normal limits. When you do, your size changes by an additional category: growing either a second size larger if you had cast the enlarge spell or a second size smaller if you had cast the reduce spell. Your size can’t be larger than Huge or smaller than Tiny by overloading the brooch, and your damage and weight are increased or decreased as if you were affected by a second instance of the <i>enlarge/reduce</i> spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">When you return to your original size after overloading the brooch, you can’t move or take actions until after your next turn. Once the brooch has been overloaded, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.</p>

Unarmed attacks with these gloves deal either bludgeoning or piercing damage (your choice).</p>
