		<description>
			<p>These wands are sometimes found in the hands of clandestine mages posing as simple townsfolk. Its magic wax and iron design resembles a candle and candlestick. The wand produces a harmless, magical flame that is indistinguishable from normal candlelight, although the wax never melts or changes shape. The flame is harmless and casts bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for another 5 feet. While holding the wand, you can extinguish or relight the flame as a bonus action.</p>
			<p class="indent">This wand has 7 charges. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast either the <i>message</i> (no charges) or <i>sending</i> spell (3 charges) from it. Alternatively, when you cast a spell of 5th level or lower while holding the wand, you can expend 1 of the wand's charges per spell slot level to ignore the spell's verbal components. Any spell that requires a target to hear its verbal component gains no benefit from this property.</p>
			<p class="indent">The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dusk. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the magical flame burns out and the wand becomes a mundane candle and candlestick.</p>

	<element name="War Standard of Battlecries" type="Magic Item" source="The Griffon's Saddlebag Book 1" id="ID_TGSB_B1_MAGIC_ITEM_WAR_STANDARD_OF_BATTLECRIES" >
		<description>
			<p>This magic battle standard reinforces the fervor of nearby allies. The standard stands up to 10 feet tall but can be collapsed down to 2 feet tall for transport. You can extend the standard to its full height as an action and either hold it aloft with one hand or plant it upright in an unoccupied space on solid ground. You can retrieve the planted standard when you enter its space (no action required). While the standard is extended, allies within 15 feet of it at the start of combat gain a +3 bonus to their initiative.</p>
			<p class="indent">This standard has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you're within 15 feet of the extended standard, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 of its charges to shout the command word, “Charge!” and immediately take the Dash action (no action required). When you do, other allies within 15 feet of the standard can take the Dash action as a bonus action on their next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can concentrate on the banner over the course of a short rest to change the emblem depicted on it.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the <em>detect magic</em> spell from it. The wand regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent">The rope rematerializes at the base of the flames after 1 minute. Once the rope has been lit, it can't be used again in this way until the next dawn. The rope can only be cut by magical means and becomes a nonmagical length of rope once cut.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Warband Strike.</i></b> When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your attacks and expend 1 charge as a bonus action to direct one of your allies to attack. When you do, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Form Ranks.</i></b> You can expend 1 charge as an action to command one of your allies to move to a more advantageous position and bolster their resolve. When you do, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains 2d4 + 2 temporary hit points that last for 1 minute and can use its reaction to move up to half its speed, without provoking opportunity attacks.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Forced Endurance.</i></b> When a friendly creature other than you within 30 feet that can see or hear you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction and expend 2 charges to prevent that creature from falling unconscious and drop to 1 hit point instead. Once this property has been used on a creature, that creature can't benefit from it again until it finishes a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Unyielding Critical.</i></b> When a friendly creature other than you within 30 feet that can see or hear you scores a critical hit, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to amplify the brutality of the attack and add an extra 2d4 damage to the total of the attack's damage roll.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This spiderskin bag is lined with a thin layer of adhesive web. Items stored inside the bag are held in place by the web, preventing stored items from clattering around or being removed without your knowledge. While you're wearing the bag, creatures other than you have disadvantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks to steal from the bag.</p>
			<p class="indent">The bag and its eight straps adhere to the surface they're pressed against, such as your torso or the wall of a tavern. If you're wearing the bag, you can gently remove the straps from your body as an action. Other creatures that attempt to wrench the bag from you make any Strength checks to do so with disadvantage. The bag can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds. Spiderskin is pliable and stretches easily, allowing the bag to shrink and grow to accommodate the objects placed inside to some degree.</p>
			<p class="indent">Even though the eyes adorning the bag are lifeless and unmoving, they still blink on rare occasion.</p>

Your spellcasting modifier is +5 when casting <i>heroism</i> in this way</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Air Rend.</i></b> This weapon can manipulate the air around it to generate blades of wind, delivering devastating slashing attacks from range. When you take the Attack action, you can expend 1 charge to make a special ranged attack with the sword against a target you can see up to 30 feet away. If you have the Extra Attack feature, you can expend 1 or more charges to use this special attack for any of the attacks you make as part of the Attack action.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Sudden Storm.</i></b> When you hold the sword and take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and make a melee attack with the sword against that creature.

		<description>
			<p>This dark hooded lantern glows with a will-o'-wisp's flame that can reveal the final moments of a creature's life. The lantern sheds bright blue light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. You can use an action to reduce the light's reach or cover it completely.</p>
			<p class="indent">The lantern has 4 charges and regains 1d3 + 1 expended charges each day at dusk. As an action while holding the lantern, you can expend 1 of its charges and touch it to a Large or smaller corpse. When you do, a ghostly blue illusion of the fallen creature appears above its corpse and silently reenacts the last 6 seconds of its conscious life. The illusion only shows the creature's actions, such as reacting to an unseen monster or trying to extinguish the flames of a fiery trap, but does not show the responsible monster or effect. This ability has no effect on undead creatures. Once a corpse's death has been shown, it cannot be shown again.</p>
			<p class="indent">Alternatively, while holding the lantern, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to speak its command word. If there are any undead creatures within 60 feet of you that aren't behind total cover, the lantern's light flashes red before returning to its normal blue glow.</p>

		<description>
			<p>This enchanted greatsword contains a wyvern's wing that's stretched between three thin, collapsed blades. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
			<p class="indent">The sword has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges each day at dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to flick open the sword like a fan and swing it down to create a buffeting wind. When you do, you can choose for the wind to affect creatures in either a 15-foot cone in front of you or all creatures within 5 feet of you. Creatures affected by this wind in the area you designate are forced to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from you. On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn't pushed. The weapon magically collapses again as the wind settles.</p>
