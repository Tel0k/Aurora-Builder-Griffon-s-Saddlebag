		<description>
			<p>This raven-feathered mantle is almost iridescent. While wearing this mantle, you have resistance to necrotic damage and descend 60 feet per round when you fall, taking no damage from falling.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, while wearing the mantle, you can use an action to cast the <i>find familiar</i> spell from it. When you do, the familiar takes the form of a raven. If the familiar falls to 0 hit points, it can’t be summoned again until the next dusk. Otherwise, the familiar remains so long as you are attuned to the mantle.</p>

	<element name="Orator’s Quill" type="Magic Item" source="The Griffon's Saddlebag Book 1" id="ID_TGSB_B1_MAGIC_ITEM_ORATORS_QUILL" >
		<description>
			<p>This red feather quill generates its own mundane ink and acts on its own as you speak to it. While holding the quill, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to activate it. While activated, the quill magically floats upright and writes the words you speak to it on whatever stationary, nonliving surface it’s been placed on. When it reaches the edge of that surface, it begins a new line below before continuing. If the quill reaches the end of the surface, such as a piece of parchment, it taps against the surface expectantly until a new one is provided. You must be within 15 feet of the quill in order to speak to it. If the quill is behind total cover, it cannot understand you. If you speak the quill’s command word again, even if you’re not holding it, the quill deactivates and falls down. If the quill doesn’t write anything for 1 minute, it deactivates on its own.</p>

	<element name="Otyugh Cloak" type="Magic Item" source="The Griffon's Saddlebag Book 1" id="ID_TGSB_B1_MAGIC_ITEM_OTYUGH_CLOAK" >
		<description>
			<p>This gruesome, magical otyugh pelt still holds some of its natural abilities. A single tendril bearing three eyes hangs from the back of the cloak’s hood. While wearing the cloak, you can use an action to telepathically communicate with a creature you can see within 60 feet of you that can understand a language, sending either simple messages or images when you do. The receiving creature can’t respond to these messages.</p>
			<p class="indent">The tendril hanging from the hood is 3 feet long and offers some limited articulation. While wearing the cloak, you can use an action to mentally control the tendril enough to manipulate a simple object, such as open an unlocked door, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. The tendril can’t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.</p>
			<p class="indent">In addition, you can raise or lower the loak’s hood using a bonus action. While the hood is lifted, you can use an action to close your eyes and see through the eyes of the tendril. You can control the tendril while looking through the eyes in this way. When you do, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. You return to your normal senses when you reopen your eyes or lower the hood.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls you make with this magic weapon. Whenever you roll an 8 on the damage die for an attack made with this weapon, the target of the attack takes an extra 1d8 poison damage. In addition, when you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against a creature, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, the poison damage is halved and the creature is not poisoned.</p>

			<p>While holding this large shield, you gain a +1 bonus to your AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC. The bonus becomes +2 while you have at least 1 temporary hit point. While you have temporary hit points, the shield emits a slight blue glow.</p>
